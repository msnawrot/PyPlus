1) Jinja2 Templating
Jinja2 is the main way of doing templating in python.
why do we need templating?
one use case is config templates w/ variables in a yaml or json file, for different devices.
or a website - html template and a database of variables, for different users
django has a template engine built into it
another use case, an email template with variables from some source,

2) Jinja2 Constructs
we'll have some source of variables
we'll have some template file (initially start with the template being a file in a program)
we'll have some set of strings/files output from the template + variables
templates have the capability to store variables, have some logic (for loops or conditional if statements)
templates have the capability to deal with lists and dictionaries
---
what do the constructs look like?
Variables: {{ vlan}}
inside the double curly brace is an expression, whether it's simply a variable substitution or a mathmatical expression
Conditionals:
 {% if var == 'value' %}
 string of output text
 {% elif var == 'other value' %}
 next string of output text
 {% else $}
 the else clause
 {% endif %}
in the template, we need clear indicators to separate code block from just text.
elif and else are optional, endif is not.
can also nest conditional statements, if statements inside of other if statements
can nest if statements inside of for loops too.
For Loops:
 {% for item in some_list %}
 string of output {{ item }}
 {% endfor %}
# the {{ item }} refers to the {% for item... %}
Jinja2 Data Structures:
List:  {{ some_list[0] }}
can have some list and refer to elements with index values, just like python
Dictionary: {{ a_dict["key"] }}
  or {{ a_dict.key }}
Loop over a dictionary:
 {% for key in my_dict %}
 {{ key }}
 {% endfor %}

 {% for k, v in my_dict.items() %}
 some text {{ k }} and {{ v }}
 {% endfor %}

3) Jinja2 Variables
using Jinja in code:
 pip install jinja2
 from jinja2 import Template
 text1 = "some text"
 j2_template = Template(text1) # use Template class, pass it the text1 variable, and that creates a jinja object.
 output = j2_template.render() # call .render on the template
 print(output)
# making it more interesting, working with variables
 from jinja2 import Template
 bgp_conf = """
 router bgp {{ bgp_as }}
  bgp router-id 10.220.88.20
 """
 j2_template = Template(bgp_conf)
 output = j2_template.render(bgp_as=22)
 print(output)
this is valid:
 example_expr = """
 some text with expressions {{ 13 + 3 }}
 """
 j2_template = Template(example_expr)
 output = j2_template.render()
 print(output)
result is: "some text with expressions 16"
an example with multiple variables in the string:
 from jinja2 import Template
 bgp_config = """
 router bgp {{ bgp_as }}
  bgp router-id {{router_id}}
 """
 j2_template = Template(bgp_config)
 output = j2_template.render(bgp_as=22, router_id="1.1.1.1")
 print(output)
as templates grow, passing in each var in the render statement becomes unmanageable. so use dictionaries.
 from jinja2 import Template
 bgp_config = """
 router bgp {{ bgp_as }}
  bgp router-id {{ router_id }}
 """
 my_vars = {
     "bgp_as": 22,
     "router_id": "1.1.1.1"
 }
 j2_template = Template(bgp_config)
 output = j2_template.render(**my_vars)
 print(output)

4) Jinja2 Environment
using a template stored in a file:
 from jinja2 import Template
 filename = "bgp_config.j2"
 with open(filename) as f:
     my_template = f.read()
 template_vars = {
     "bgp_as": 22,
     "router_id": "1.1.1.1"
 }
 j2_template = Template(my_template) # my_template is the contents of a file as one string.
 output = j2_template.render(**template_vars)
 print(output)
problems with doing it this way:
if you have an undefined var, then the output works, with missing text, and no error.
have to do more special file handling if you want to look in other dirs (paths) for templates.
if your template includes other templates (possible) then this reading style breaks down.
THE FIX, use a Jinja2 Environment
 from jinja2 import FileSystemLoader, StrictUndefined
 from jinja2.environment import Environment
 env = Environment() # create a jinja2 Environment
 env.loader = FileSystemLoader('.') # call environment loader, using FileSystemLoader class to define where to look for templates, '.' means 'look in working directory'
 my_vars = { blah blah dict }
 template_file = 'bgp_config.j2'
 template = env.get_template(template_file) # we load the template differently that with open(), using get_template method of the env, with template_file
 output = template.render(**my_vars)
 print(output)
so it's all similar to the with open way, but this is centered around env.get_template(template_file)
in order to get the program to fail on undefined variables:
 env = Environment(undefined=StrictUndefined)
in order to search for the template file in a subdirectory:
 env.loader = FileSystemLoader('./templates/')
can even call FileSystemLoader with a list of directories to search:
 env.loader = FileSystemLoader(['.', './templates/' ])

5) Jinja2 Conditionals (Part1)
just a review of information from video 2.
oh, except he shows this conditional, which means if True, and his variable primary_ip is the bool True.
{% if primary_ip %}
{% endif %}

6) Junja2 Whitespace Stripping
conditional lines can cause extra whitespace.
remove the conditional whitespace with -
{%- if primary_ip %}
or {% if primary_ip -%}
the - negates all whitespace 'surrounding the conditional,' new lines and spaces

7) Jinja2 Conditionals (Part2)
good use case:
"""
interface GigabitEthernet0/1/0
  {% if mode == "access" %}
  switchport access vlan 400
  switchport mode access
  {%- elif mode == "trunk" %}
  switchport trunk native vlan 1
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,300,400
  switchport mode trunk
  {%- endif %}
"""
Kirk says that you should push your complexity out of the template and into the program.
template complexity can get out of hand quickly, making it very hard to debug.
...and use the whitespace stripping syntax to make the template more readable
Kirk simplifies the if, elif template above to be if, else, since there are only two modes.
